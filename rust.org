* Rust Notes
Rust is cool but can be complicated here are some resources that I frequently use during rust projects
** Modules and Names
[[https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/visibility-and-privacy.html][Visibility Rust Ref]]
[[https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/path-changes.html][Rust 2018 Changes]]
[[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26388861/how-can-i-include-a-module-from-another-file-from-the-same-project][How to split files]]
** Iterator and Ranges
Ranges can be used to specify ranges of number and iterators can be used to do some processing on them
For example
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
let num = 150;
let combined_range = (100..199).chain(200..247).chain(300..378);
// Check if the number is within any of the combined ranges
match num {
    n if combined_range.contains(&n) => {
        // Run the same code for all numbers within any of the combined ranges
        println!("Number {} is within the combined range.", num);
    }
    _ => {
        // Handle other cases if needed
        println!("Number {} is not within the combined range.", num);
    }
}
#+END_SRC
Cool!
