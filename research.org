#+title: Loafer Research
* Loafer Notes
** Scope
Build Socket to Connect To MPV IPC
IPC should exposed
- Skip / Forward
- Add to queue of videos
HTML frontend
- To skip / control
- Add videos to queue and control playback
** MPV architecture
*** Embeddable C API
C API that control over playback (libmpv)
[[https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/libmpv/client.h]]
Rust Bindings Option is Available with  [[https://crates.io/crates/libmpv][libmpv-rs]]
*** C Plugins
[[https://mpv.io/manual/master/#c-plugins][here]]
Not really sure how this differs from libmpv, apparently it uses libmpv
Potential use case for Zig here if C Plugin route is taken
I can also write rust code to compile to .so file here and be used as a plugin
*** Lua / JS Scripting API
I believe these use libmpv as the backend so I could just use that instead
